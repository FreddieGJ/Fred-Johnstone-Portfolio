        My name is Fred Johnstone and welcome to my portfolio. 
        My journey began half way through the first Lockdown of 2020 in Cambridge UK 
        when I decided (like many others I’m sure) to try making video games. 
        This idea eventually “fizzeled” out as it were but my interest was peaked with coding.
        <br>
        My main strength is working with people, and I try to channel that into the websites I make,
        making them readable, and engaging for targeted audiences. I also firmly belive that communication 
        is key to a good working team and I strive to bring that mindset to evey project that I participate in.
