# Fred-Johnstone-Portfolio
My portfolio that shows off my skills so far
Hello and welcome to my README for my portfolio.
The purpose of this website is to show you what I am capable of. 
It is an ongoing project and I will be adding to it as I progress through my front-end Web developer journey.

There are five (5) websites that I have included to show my abilities.
The first and main one is the portfolio homepage itself. 
Here I provide links to my other "practice sites" as well as a brief description of myself and the websites that I have made.

Casita:
Casita was my first main project that I made and incorporates CSS, and JavaScript.

Bistro:
Bistro is a very "barebones" site that I wrote to practice maing navigation bars in CSS.

Mini Monsters:
Mini Monsters was made to practice my skills with Flex-Box CSS. It is a fake business website that I wrote to show off some of my other hobbies. 

Cat Appreciation Team:
Cat Appreciation Team (C.A.T) was made to practice Media Queries and website responsiveness. 
It is able to be viewed easily on Mobile and Tablet and switch seamlessly between viewing modes.
Also my cat is cute and I thought It would be fun to make a website for her. 

Whilst I describe my skills with the portfolio homepage, I also use aspects of all the other sites on display to make the portfolio
feel like a complete website. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy!
